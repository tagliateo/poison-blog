## Unveiling "**Verses Under a Killing Moon**": A Journey Through The Macabre in Verse

I'm thrilled to finally announce the release of my debut poetry collection, **"Verses Under a Killing Moon"**! This project has been a labor of love, pouring my heart and soul onto the page to explore themes of dark thoughts that run through your mind at night.

**Verses Under a Killing Moon** takes you on a journey through fear, paranoia, and loneliness with raw honesty and lyrical beauty. Each poem delves into the depths of muder, dark academia, isolotaion, and vulnerability, offering glimpses into those thoughts that give you the creeps. Whether you're seeking solace, reflection, or simply an appreciation for the power of words, this collection has something to offer everyone.

**Here's a sneak peek into what you can expect:**

* **Ode to Thee:** This poem explores unrequitted love and confusion.
* **Nocturne at the Stacks:** In this piece, I delve into dark academia.
* **Beneath the Willow:** This powerful poem explores the powerful theme of regret.

Writing **"Verses Under a Killing Moon"** has been a deeply personal experience, and I can't wait to share it with the world. I hope these poems resonate with you, spark your own creativity, and leave you with a sense of connection.
